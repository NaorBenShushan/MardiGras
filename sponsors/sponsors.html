                        The World Famous Museum of Death was founded in June, 1995 when JD Healy and Cathee
                        Shultz decided to fill the void in death education in this country and made death their
                        life’s work.
                        Evolving from the controversial Rita Dean art gallery, the Museum of
                        Death was originally located in San Diego’s 1st mortuary- the building itself once owned
                        by Wyatt Earp. Now located in Hollywood, California and New OrleansDeath was originally

                        Museum of Death houses the world’s largest collection of serial killer artwork, antique
                        funeral ephemera, mortician and coroners instruments, Manson Family memorabilia, pet
                        death taxidermy, crime scene photographs and so much more! Each location is entirely
                        unique as the museum does not feature any replicas or duplicates of the exhibits or
                        artifacts.</p>

                        So
                        we created a place where kids use play, shared exploration, and conversation to
                        connect
                        with the people and world around them. A place where kids can be the amazing humans
                        they
                        are. A place where wonderful things happen daily.
                        <br> We believe that what you experience as a child shapes the adult you become.
                        That
                        means you can change a child’s entire trajectory by giving them access to safe,
                        innovative, and educational play experiences. And that’s the stuff we live for.
                        We’re
                        here to show children they matter. We exist to strengthen and support families. And
                        we’re going to have. We believe that the child’s potential
                        inspires and guide us, we value learning for ourselves, for children and for
                        families,

                        Orleans’
                        Voodoo tradition and Mambo Asogwe in Haitian Voodoo. As a true mystic, she

                        As an artist, Mary designs her work with an empath's heart, a historian's detail

                            when JD Healy and Cathee

                            life’s work.

                            wonderful things happen. So
                            we created a place where kids use play, shared exploration,
                            and conversation to connect
                            with the people and world around them. A place where kids
                            can be the amazing humans they
                            are. A place where wonderful things happen daily.
                            <br> We believe that what you experience as a child shapes
                            the adult you become. That
                            means you can change a child’s entire trajectory by giving
                            them access to safe,
                            innovative, and educational play experiences. And that’s the
                            stuff we live for. We’re
                            here to show children they matter. We exist to strengthen
                            and support families. And
                            we’re going to have. We believe that the child’s potential
                            inspires and guide us, we value learning for ourselves, for
                            children and for families,
                            stewardship and resilience inform our choices and decisions
                            today to increase our
                            capacity in meeting future challenges and opportunities and

                            Creole whose family came to New Orleans in 1718. She is
                            Voodoo Queen in New Orleans’
                            Voodoo tradition and Mambo Asogwe in Haitian Voodoo. As a
                            true mystic, she combines her
                            abilities as Shaman, Mambo, Voodoo Queen and Psychic into
                            all aspects of her life.

                            As an artist, Mary designs her work with an empath's heart,
                            a historian's detail and a
                            researcher's mind. Her Psychic abilities have always lent
                            second sight into all aspects
                            of her work. Add impeccable storytelling, ritual execution

                            investigations and spirit connections, and these gifts

                            knowledge works in tandem
                            with avid research creating a unique and holistic approach
